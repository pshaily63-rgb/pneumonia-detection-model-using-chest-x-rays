overview
Introduction 
Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that continues to be a major health 
concern worldwide, especially in children, older adults, and individuals with 
weakened immune systems. Early detection plays a vital role in ensuring timely 
treatment and reducing complications. Chest X-ray imaging is one of the most 
commonly used diagnostic tools for identifying pneumonia. However, 
interpreting X-rays manually can be challenging, time-consuming, and 
sometimes inconsistent due to human error or limited availability of 
experienced radiologists.

Objectives: 
The main objectives of this project are: 
 To develop an automated deep-learning model capable of detecting 
pneumonia from chest X-ray images using the DenseNet121 architecture. 
 To preprocess and augment the dataset to improve the model’s 
robustness and ensure better generalization across varying image 
qualities. 
 To train and fine-tune the model for achieving high accuracy, precision, 
recall, and AUC performance on the classification task. 
 To evaluate the model using standard performance metrics, including 
confusion matrix, classification report, and Grad-CAM visualizations for 
interpretability. 
 To build a complete and functional diagnostic pipeline that can assist 
radiologists and healthcare professionals by providing fast and reliable 
predictions.
